# Milestone Project 7-9
## Habits App

Milestone Project 7-9 of "100 days of SwiftUI" course.</br>
Day 47: https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/47

## Challenge

>This time your goal is to build a habit-tracking app, for folks who want to keep track of how much they do certain things. That might be learning a language, practicing an instrument, exercising, or whatever – they get to decide which activities they add, and track it however they want.
>
>At the very least, this means there should be a list of all activities they want to track, plus a form to add new activities – a title and description should be enough.
>
>For a bigger challenge, tapping one of the activities should show a detail screen with the description, how many times they have completed it, plus a button incrementing their completion count.
>
>For an even bigger challenge, use Codable and UserDefaults to load and save all your data.
