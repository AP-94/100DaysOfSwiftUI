# Milestone Project 13-15
## iForgetNames App

Milestone Project 13-15 of "100 days of SwiftUI" course.</br>
Day 77: https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/77
and Day 78: https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/78

This Project divides in 2 parts:

- Day 60: ImagePicker and list of persons
- Day 61: Added MapView and location of user

## Challenges

For day 77:


>- Wrap UIImagePickerController so it can be used to select photos.
>- Detect when a new photo is imported, and immediately ask the user to name the photo.
>- Save that name and photo somewhere safe.
>- Show all names and photos in a list, sorted by name.
>- Create a detail screen that shows a picture full size.
>- Decide on a way to save all this data.

For day 78:

> When you’re viewing a picture that was imported, you should show a map with a pin that marks where they were when that picture was added. It might be on the same screen side by side with the photo, it might be shown or hidden using a segmented control, or perhaps it’s on a different screen – it’s down to you. Regardless, you know how to drop pins, and you also know how to use the center coordinate of map views, so the only thing left to figure out is how to get the user’s location to save alongside their text and image.
